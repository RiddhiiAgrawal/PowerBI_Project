This project demonstrates the power of data visualization using Power BI to represent online survey results. By leveraging Power BI's robust features, I transformed raw survey data into insightful and interactive visualizations that provide a clear understanding of survey responses.  
Utilized Power Query to clean and reshape the survey data, including unpivoting multiple-choice responses for easier analysis.   
Created dynamic dashboards that allow users to explore survey results through various filters and slicers.  
   
Implemented a variety of charts and graph:   
* Treemap to showcase the countries of survey takers for an immediate visual understanding of the geographical distribution of respondents.    
* Two gauge charts to display: Happiness with work-life balance and Happiness with salary. Both charts use a scale from 0 to 10    
* Stacked Column Chart to visualize the most favorite programming languages among respondents.    
* Stacked Bar Chart to display the average high salary according to profession.
